# rksuid
 Rust implementation of Segment.io's ksuid

 I have no association with Segment, just a fan of the format.

# Inspiration
Segment [published](https://segment.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-uuid/) a nifty UUID format and I thought it'd be fun to implement a compatible version in pure Rust as a way to learn the language more thoroughly and keep myself sharp while looking for a new coding gig.
